(verse 1)

ebbs and flows, like rivers go
from quiet to quite a ragin
people show politicos
they're done with lights and stagin

clown cars full of corporate shills
and loudmouths on pure ego
bought and paid for swindlers
yet we all forsook our hero

(chorus)
we deserve what we get
cuz we get what we give
and we lose every bet
cuz we don't give a shit

we shit where we live
and we live for this shit
that keeps them getting richer
and keeps us working shifts


(verse 2)

jack and jill went up the hill
to fetch a pail of water
but the hill ignored the lead
and the world getting much hotter

the water then all turned to steam
like ears of our tyrants
cuz jack and jill then left the hill
and came back with allied riots


(chorus)
we deserve what we get
cuz we get what we give
and we lose every bet
cuz we don't give a shit

we shit where we live
and we live for this shit
that keeps them getting richer
and keeps us working shifts


(softer and increasingly slower)

ebbs and flows, like rivers go
from quiet to quite a ragin
people show politicos
they're done with lights and stagin
