I don't where we're going
But I got an idea where we're from
And the bubble's keep growin
Shiny now but they'll pop and be less fun

And I hear people sayin
We can't change so why even try?
It's a game that we're playin
It's the winners who keep feeding that lie

I see no future
Just the possibility
That we could be rulers
or in the mud down on our knees

The game isn't over
Anger always comes and goes but
One love forever
History's writ by what we chose
