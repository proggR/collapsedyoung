# Verse 1

Ive been that lonely heart
I've seen the light
I've lived my only start
I've been wrong and and I've been right

I've been led astray
I've led some strays myself
I've learned I've been betrayed
But we all betray ourselves

# Chorus

And when I get there
To the place that I can see
Maybe then
I'll finally feel free

# Verse 2

We've been those jaded souls
Built up and then torn down
Carved up with graded goals
We're stuck in the playground

We've been switched for bait
Landlords tossed us to the pack
You get rich, we get irrate
We're coming for our payback

# Chorus

And when we get there
To the place we all can see
Maybe then
we'll finally be free
