I don't know where we're going
but I got an idea where we're from
and the bubbles keep growing
shiny now, but they'll pop and be less fun

and i hear people saying
we can't change so why even try
its a game that we're playing
its the winners who keep feeding that lie

I see no future,
just the possibilities that
we could be rulers
or in the mud down on our knees

the game isn't over
anger always comes and goes
but one love forever
history's writ by what we chose
