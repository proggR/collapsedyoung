# Collapsed Young

![Poster](./a_poster.jpg)

Written and recorded now 7 years ago, back in the pre-Trump age, this unreleased album is now being launched, to the very URL the posters made in 2016 referenced. 

Originally considering `"Collapsed Young"` as the artist name, it became the album title while `"Bum Trip"` was for a bit the artist name (contrived from my initials, BT), until landing on the name `sgt.groucho`.

The full album, including graphics and lyrics, can be found in the `fullalbum` directory. The audio is taken from laptop webcam recordings, included in the `wip_assets` directory, along with iterations of graphics and audio.

One song (Working Class Hero) is clearly not original. Please don't sue me, I'm not selling this album/profiting from the cover, its just a great song that helped pull together the overarching concept. RIP John <3
