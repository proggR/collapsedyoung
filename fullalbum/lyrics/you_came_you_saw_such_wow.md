You bitch of opiates for the masses
but you opiate yourself
you say you worship science
but you still ignore your health
You learn of economics
but show me where's your wealth
You came, you saw, yourself

You see a better future
But you're blurry in the now
You claim to know a better way
But knowing isn't how
Change has ever come before
Or will come again you vow
You came, you saw, such wow

One by one you'll knock'em down
These vices hold you back
Two by two we'll known'em down
Those who hold us in the cracks
I still think I see a better way
But now its much more clear
We only see our better days
When we give up all our fears
All our fears
