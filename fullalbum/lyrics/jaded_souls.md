I've been that lonely heart
I've seen the light
I've lived my only start
I've been wrong and I've been right

I've been led astray
And I've led some strays myself
I've learned I've been betrayed
But we all betray ourselves

So when I get there
To the place that I can see
Maybe then
I'll finally be free

We've been those jaded souls
built up and then torn down
carved up with graded goals
stuck on the playground

We've been switched for bait
Landlords toss us to the pack
You get rich we get irate
We're coming for our payback

And when we get there
to the place we all can see
Maybe then
We'll finally be free
