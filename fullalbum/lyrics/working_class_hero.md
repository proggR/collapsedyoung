As soon as you're born they make you feel small
By giving you no time instead of it all
Til the pain is to big you feel nothing at all

A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be

They hurt you at home and they hit you at school
They hate you if you're clever and they despise a fool
Til you're so fucking crazy you can't follow their rules

A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be

They torture and scare you for 20 odd years
Then they expect you to pick a career
Til you can't really function you're so full of fear

A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be

Keep you doped with religion and sex and TV
and you think you're so clever and classless and free
but you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see

A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be

A working class hero used to be something to be
til we gave the keys to the castle to the dickheads at the top
who only care about themselves
or more accurately only care about their pocket books
They take more and more and more
at the expense of more and more and more...
and they're never going to stop

There's room at the top they're telling you still
but first you must learn how to smile as you kill
if you want to be like the folks on the hill

A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be

Well if you want to be a hero, just follow me
Well if you want to be a hero, just follow me
